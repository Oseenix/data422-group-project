Team held its sixth meeting online through zoom.
After deliberate consideration and discussion by the team members, we decided that movies dataset/database might be too simple for the project, hence, we had fallen back to a mix of **Jinze's** topics and **Jeffrey's** topics. Now we decided to look for the datasets for:
 - CPI 
 - HPI (Housing price index)
 - Tourism
 - Transportation

**Ansar** was assigned task to get data for Tourism & Transportation. **Jeffrey** was given task to write up some scenarios where datasets related to these diverse topics can be of interest. He would also try to find out the relationships among this kind of topics. **Jinze** was given the task of finding data sources for CPI & HPI.
